/**
 * Proves, against a running app, that an error report reaches PostHog's queue
 * carrying useful text and carrying nothing of the user's.
 *
 *   node scripts/smoke-error-telemetry.mjs [--timeout-ms 120000] [--keep-log]
 *
 * Why this exists rather than only unit tests. The redaction is four layers —
 * the reporter packs the error, the loopback route hands it over, the server
 * cleans it, and the event allowlist re-checks the result — and each layer is
 * unit tested in isolation. What no unit test can show is that they are wired
 * to each other in the shipped build. During development of this feature the
 * live run caught two faults the unit tests could not:
 *
 *   1. VS Code's cleaner, configured the way VS Code configures it, deletes a
 *      known directory as a prefix. A path under the user's home directory then
 *      kept the rest — "/Users/you/work/acme-repo/plan.md" was cleaned to
 *      "/work/acme-repo/plan.md", repository name intact.
 *   2. The probe only revealed it because it used a real path under the real
 *      home directory. A fixture path would have passed.
 *
 * So this smoke deliberately builds its probes from `os.homedir()` rather than
 * from a literal, and asserts on the real user name of whoever runs it.
 *
 * Silence must never read as success: the run fails if no report arrives at
 * all, which is what a broken loopback route or a dead reporter looks like.
 *
 * Requires a built app (`pnpm --filter @dev-fast/review-desktop app:build`).
 * Not part of `pnpm test` — it launches the application.
