// Turns a raw JavaScript error into reportable telemetry properties.
//
// This module is the only place that sees raw error text on the way to PostHog.
// Callers hand it the `error` envelope of a loopback telemetry request, and it
// returns four things: the class name, the message with paths, addresses and
// secrets replaced by markers, a digest of the original message, and stack
// frames rewritten to start inside the shipped Review bundle.
//
// The message is cleaned with a port of VS Code's cleaner (telemetry-clean-text
// .ts) rather than a rule of our own, because that one is proven at scale in the
// product this is a fork of.
//
// ui-telemetry-events.ts re-checks the result independently — the frames
// against a bundle-path pattern, the message against the same secret shapes plus
// a refusal of any surviving path separator — so a bug here cannot by itself
// leak a path.
